# NYC-COVID-19
Association between Characteristics of venues and COVID-19 confirmed cases in New York City neighborhoods

This project aims to identify COVID-19 high-risk neighborhoods based on their characteristics of the distribution of venues. It will help properly allocate medical resources to high-risk neighborhoods during outbreaks in other major American cities.

The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases can be found on https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/covid-nyc. The list of neighborhoods and their location can be found through https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34572. I will use Foursquare location data to extract venue category and locations.
